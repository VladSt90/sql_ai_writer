Generate detailed description for each table that you see in this database context.

Database context: CREATE TABLE department (creation VARCHAR, name VARCHAR, budget_in_billions VARCHAR)

You must output a valid JSON array of tables descriptions.
Each table description is a plain string with detailed description of a table.
So the output should be a valid JSON array of plain strings.
Each table description should include:
- names of columns of the table with column types (names of columns should be same written as they written in database context),
- table name (table name should be same written,
as it written in database context).

You should output only a valid JSON, nothing else.
