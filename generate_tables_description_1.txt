Generate detailed description for each table that you see in this database context.

Database context: CREATE TABLE department (creation VARCHAR, name VARCHAR, budget_in_billions VARCHAR)

Expected output:
JSON with array of tables descriptions.
Each table description here is an object like
{
  name: table name,
  description: table description,
  columns: array of columns descriptions
}
Column description is an object like
{
  name: column name,
  description: column description,
  type: column data type
}

Return only valid JSON, nothing else.

Example output:
[
  {
    "name": "employees",
    "description": "This table stores information about company employees. It contains columns for employee ID, employee name, position, and start date. The employee_id column represents the unique identifier for each employee. The name column holds the full name of the employee. The position column describes the employee's job title.

        "type": "INT"
      },
      {

        "description": "The full name of the employee.",
        "type": "VARCHAR"
      },
      {
